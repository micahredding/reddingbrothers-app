  This is a song about writer's block. My problem wasn't having too few ideas, but having no idea of which direction to go with them. So I sat down and wrote this song. And ironically, for a song about writer's block, I wrote it in one pass, totally spontaneously, with no pre-planning or editing of the words. I just hit record, and these are the words that came out.

  We've also done some experimental stuff with multiple takes of me singing. But we used all of them here. Enjoy the weirdness.
