snow-globe, don't you know enough to question
everything that you find?
snow-globe, don't you know enough to question
everything in your mind?

there are [c]grass-stains in my [g]hair
and i can't [am]perceive it [d]yet
don't you [c]know it will [g]snow in [am]time? [d]
there are grass-stains in my hair
and i can't perceive it yet
don't you know it will snow in time?

[c]it's hard [g]enough to question [am]my [g]indiscretions
[c]it's not [g]enough to tell you [am]why
it's hard enough to question my indiscretions
and i wonder if it's time
